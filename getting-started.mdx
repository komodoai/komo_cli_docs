## Setup global configuration

The first step to getting up and running with Komodo is to set up a global configuration file which stores your Komodo credentials as well as backend details that will power your jobs.

The file is expected at `~/.komo/config.yaml`. Below we provide a sample and go over how to populate it.

```yaml
komodo_api_key: ABC1234
backends:
  local:
    type: local
    config: {}
  k8s:
    type: kubernetes
    config:
      host: https://my-k8s-host.com
      bearer_token: KLMNO1234
```

### Komodo API Key

You can obtain your Komodo API Key by providing your login credentials via the `komo get-api-key` command. [Find more details on this command here.](./komo-cli-reference/command/get-api-key)

### Backends

You can configure varius backend under the `backends` key which contains a dictionary, mapping backend name to the backend config.

Each backend specification must include a type and a config.

#### Supported Backend Types

* Local
* Kubernetes


### Supported Backend Configurations

#### Local

The Local backend requires no further configuration, the sample can be copied as it. However, please make sure you have Docker installed and running.

#### Kubernetes

The Kubernetes backend requires two configuration fields:

* `host` - this is address of your Kubernetes cluster API.

The value for `host` can be obtained in the following way

```bash
âžœ  ~ kubectl config view | grep "server" | sed 's/.*\/\/\(.*\):.*/https:\/\/\1/'

https://my-k8s-host.com
```

* `bearer_token` - this is the token used to authenticate with your Kubernetes cluster.
The value for the `bearer` token host can be obtained using the following commands

```bash
CLUSTER_NAME=$(kubectl config view | grep -m 1 "name" | awk '{ print $2 }')
echo "$CLUSTER_NAME"
APISERVER=$(kubectl config view -o jsonpath="{.clusters[?(@.name==\"$CLUSTER_NAME\")].cluster.server}")
echo "$APISERVER"
TOKEN=$(kubectl get secrets -o jsonpath="{.items[?(@.metadata.annotations['kubernetes\.io/service-account\.name']=='default')].data.token}"|base64 -d)
echo "$TOKEN"
```
