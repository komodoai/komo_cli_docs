## init
The `init` command is used to initialize a new Komodo project in the current directory. This command creates a new Komodo configuration file and sets up your project to use Komodo's services. To initialize a new project, run the following command:

```
komo init
```

This will create a new ".komo" directory with configuration in the `project.yaml` file. You can edit this file to configure your project settings.
