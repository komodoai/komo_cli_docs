## machine

The `machine` command provides functionality for managing and interacting with Komodo machines. These machines can be used to interectively develop your applications and iterate on your work using the exact same platform that runs your jobs. You can use this command to add new machines, remove existing machines, or view the status of your machines.

### machine start
The `machine start` command is used to start a Komodo machine. This command takes a `NAME` argument to identify the new machine, and supports several options to customize its configuration.

#### Usage
```
komo machine start [OPTIONS] NAME
```

#### Options
```
The -b/--backend option specifies the name of the backend to use for the new machine. If not provided, the default backend will be used.
```

```
The -r/--resource option specifies the type of resource to use for the job as defined in the project's configuration file. This option is ignored for local jobs.
```

```
The -c/--config option allows you to override any parameters in your .komo/project.yaml configuration file. You can use the '.' character to set nested attributes, and separate multiple parameters with commas. For example, to override the config['backends']['k8s']['workspace'] parameter and set it to null, you would use --config backends.k8s.workspace=null.
```

```
The -d/--detach option starts the machine in detached mode, which allows you to continue using the terminal while the machine is running in the background.
```

### machine list
The `machine list` command is used to list all the jobs that have been executed on Komodo. To list all jobs, simply run the following command:

### machine shell
The `machine shell` command is used to open a shell into a running Komodo machine. This allows you to interact with the job's environment and execute commands inside it. To open a shell, you need to specify the machine name as an argument. For example, to open a shell into machine `machine123`, you can use the following command:

```
komo machine shell machine1234
```

### machine terminate
The `machine terminate` command is used to terminate the machine. To terminate a machine, you need to specify the machine name as an argument. For example, to terminate a machine `machine123`, you can use the following command:

```
komo machine terminate machine1234
```
