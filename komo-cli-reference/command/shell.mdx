## shell
The `shell` command is used to open a shell into a running Komodo job. This allows you to interact with the job's environment and execute commands inside it. To open a shell, you need to specify the job ID as an argument. For example, to open a shell into job `job123`, you can use the following command:

```
komo shell job123
```
